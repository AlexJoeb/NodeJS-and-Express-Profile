In this project, I've created a gorgeous portfolio site to showcase the great projects that I've built. The site contains a modern landing page, an about page where I share contact info, practice my elevator pitch and talk a little about myself, and a series of project pages to show off and detail at least of my first five projects from the Full-Stack JavaScript Techdegree.
